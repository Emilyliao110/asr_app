awesome camera I wanted a full-frame Canon digital for some time and was always a bit put off by the price truly amazing piece of kid with the price is too good to be true it is bought from bass Wireless and it was a great Market version I'm 100% positive this was sold as if it was a brand new item coming from Canon to be deceptive are you able to adjust the temperature setting the good electric kettle but there is room for improvement idealty steamer the size of the glass teapot is just right for daily use and with high-quality and thick easy-to-operate easy to clean
